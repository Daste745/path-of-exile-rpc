# Path of Exile RPC
This is still a very simple app, that I got working in a few hours. It displays your current location and time that the RPC client has been running.

I am planning to add more stuff, but I'm still not sure how to get some info, such as character and league name, character class and so on.

All info is gathered from client logs (logs/Client.txt).
